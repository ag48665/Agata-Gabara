## Project Overview

This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset using Python.
The aim is to explore global happiness trends, compare regions, and understand factors associated with happiness levels.

The project performs statistical analysis, trend analysis, and data visualization across countries and years.

This is a practical Data Science and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project based on real-world data.

---

## Dataset

The dataset (`world_happiness_report.csv`) contains:

* Country
* Region
* Year
* Happiness Score
* GDP per capita
* Health (life expectancy)
* Freedom
* Trust (government corruption)
* Generosity

The data is analyzed across multiple years to observe global and regional trends.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Statistical aggregation
* Data visualization

---

## Key Analyses

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

* overall dataset summary
* statistics by year
* statistics by region
* top and bottom happiest countries

### 2. Trend Analysis

* global happiness trend over time
* regional happiness comparison
* year-to-year changes in happiness

### 3. Distribution Analysis

* histogram of happiness scores
* regional boxplots
* variability across countries

### 4. Correlation & Relationships

* happiness vs GDP
* happiness vs health
* correlation heatmap
* change distribution

## How the Program Works

The script loads the dataset, performs statistical analysis, and provides a menu interface allowing the user to run different analyses and generate plots.

Charts are automatically saved to a folder on the computer.

---

## Installation

Clone repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

Install required libraries:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

---

## How to Run

Place the file in the same folder:

```
world_happiness_report.csv
world_happiness_analysis.py
```

Run:

```
python world_happiness_analysis.py
```

Choose an option from the menu (0–14) to generate statistics or plots.
