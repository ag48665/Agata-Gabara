# Microsoft Excel Functions & Data Handling Project

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of practical Microsoft Excel exercises demonstrating my ability to work with data, analyse datasets and apply logical problem-solving using Excel formulas.

The project covers core functions used in business environments such as reporting, data validation, and troubleshooting incorrect data.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

* Data analysis
* Logical thinking
* Problem solving
* Data validation
* Working with structured datasets
* Troubleshooting spreadsheet errors

## Excel Functions Covered

The project includes practical examples of:

* Mathematical formulas
* Logical operators (IF, AND, OR)
* Statistical functions
* Lookup and reference functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, XLOOKUP)
* Text manipulation
* Date and time calculations
* Dynamic array formulas
* Conditional formatting

## Project Structure

Each file represents a separate topic and practical exercise:

* **Section2_Formulas101** – basic arithmetic and formula usage
* **Section3_Logical_Operators** – IF statements and conditional logic
* **Section4_Statistical_Functions** – AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX
* **Section5_Lookup_Reference_Functions** – VLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, XLOOKUP
* **Section6_Text_Functions** – string manipulation and cleaning data
* **Section7_Date_Time_Functions** – working with dates and time calculations
* **Section8_Formula_Formatting** – conditional formatting rules
* **Section9_Dynamic_Array_Formulas** – FILTER, UNIQUE, SORT
* **Section10_Bonus_Functions** – advanced formulas and combined logic

## Why This Project Matters

Excel is widely used in IT support, finance, operations, and data handling roles.
This project demonstrates my ability to:

* understand structured data
* investigate incorrect values
* trace errors in formulas
* automate repetitive calculations

## Tools Used

* Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365)
