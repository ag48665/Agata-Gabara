# Airline Customer Satisfaction – Data Analysis Dissertation

## Project Description

This repository contains my Bachelor of Science dissertation project focused on analyzing airline customer satisfaction using real-world passenger data.

The goal of this project was to explore how flight delays, travel class, and flight distance influence passenger satisfaction and overall flight experience.

## Key Objectives

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Identify relationships between delays and satisfaction
* Analyze the impact of passenger demographics
* Create clear visualizations for interpretation

---

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes airline passenger information such as:

* Age
* Gender
* Flight distance
* Departure delay
* Arrival delay
* Travel class (Business / Economy)
* Satisfaction rating

---

## Technologies and Tools

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
* Tableau (dashboard visualization)
* Git & GitHub

---

## Analysis Performed

* Handling missing values
* Data transformation
* Correlation analysis
* Delay pattern analysis
* Customer segmentation
* Visualization of key trends

---

## Visualizations Included

The project contains multiple visual analyses:

* Age distribution histogram
* Gender distribution pie chart
* Flight distance vs delay analysis
* Departure vs arrival delay correlation
* Customer satisfaction treemap
* Interactive Tableau dashboard

---

## Key Findings

* Flight delays strongly reduce passenger satisfaction
* Business class passengers show higher satisfaction levels
* Arrival delay is highly correlated with departure delay
* Long-distance flights are more sensitive to delays

---

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Work with real datasets
* Clean and preprocess data
* Perform exploratory data analysis
* Create meaningful visualizations
* Interpret analytical results
* Use GitHub for project documentation and version control
