# Hangman Web Game (PHP + HTML + CSS)

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Hangman game.
The application was created as a web development practice project to demonstrate understanding of front-end and basic back-end technologies.

The website includes multiple pages, user interaction through forms, and a structured layout using reusable PHP components.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* PHP
* Basic web forms (login & registration)
* Navigation and layout structure

## 🧩 Features

* Home (landing) page
* User login form
* User registration form
* Ranking/scoreboard page
* Navigation bar and sidebar
* Reusable PHP header and footer (common.php)

## 🖥️ How It Works

The application consists of several web pages connected through a navigation bar.

Users can:

* Register a new account
* Log in using username and password
* View ranking/scoreboard
* Navigate between pages

PHP is used to dynamically generate common page elements (header, navigation and footer) and manage page structure.
