## 🔬 Flagship Research Project

## Tumor Immune Evasion in Lung Cancer — Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis

🔗 https://github.com/ag48665/tcga-lung-immune-evasion-scRNAseq

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis investigating how lung cancer tumors evade the immune system using publicly available human tumor scRNA-seq datasets.

This project focuses on identifying immune cell populations within the tumor microenvironment and analysing gene expression patterns associated with immune suppression and T-cell dysfunction.

### Biological Question
How do tumor cells alter the tumor microenvironment to suppress immune response?

### Methods & Workflow
* Single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing and quality control (Scanpy)
* Filtering low-quality cells and mitochondrial genes
* Normalization and highly variable gene selection
* PCA and UMAP dimensionality reduction
* Clustering and immune cell type annotation
* Marker gene identification
* Analysis of immune checkpoint gene expression (PD-1 / PD-L1 / CTLA4)

### Biological Relevance
* Explains mechanisms of tumor immune evasion
* Relevant to cancer immunotherapy
* Demonstrates research-level bioinformatics workflow
