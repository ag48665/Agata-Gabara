## 🧬 Featured Projects

## 🤖 Protein Function Analysis using AI (ESM-2)

🔗 [https://github.com/ag48665/protein-language-model-analysis](https://github.com/ag48665/Agata-Gabara/tree/main/Python%20Projects/Protein-Dataset-Analysis)

Computational protein sequence analysis using a deep learning protein language model (ESM-2) to investigate structural and functional patterns in amino acid sequences.

**Methods**

* Protein sequence preprocessing (Biopython)
* Amino acid composition analysis
* Sequence length distribution
* Motif / prefix detection
* Deep learning embeddings (ESM-2)

**Biological Relevance**

* Sequence patterns relate to protein structure and function
* Embeddings capture similarity between proteins
* Demonstrates modern AI approaches used in computational biology

## 🧪 Promoter Sequence Analysis (Biopython)

🔗 https://github.com/ag48665/Agata-Gabara/tree/main/Biopython-Projects/promoter_project

Exploratory computational genomics project analysing *E. coli* DNA sequences to distinguish promoter and non-promoter regions using sequence-based features.

**Methods**

* DNA sequence preprocessing (Biopython)
* GC-content calculation
* k-mer (3-mer) frequency analysis
* Class comparison (promoter vs non-promoter)
* Biological motif interpretation

**Key Findings**

* Promoter regions showed strong AT-rich patterns
* Non-promoters contained mixed motifs (e.g. ATG, TGA)
* k-mer composition provided discriminative features for classification
