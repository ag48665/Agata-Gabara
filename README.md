# 👩‍💻 Agata Gabara — Bioinformatics & Computational Biology Portfolio

Early-career bioinformatics and computational biology candidate with hands-on experience analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data using R and Python.
My main research interest is **computational cancer genomics** — understanding tumor biology and clinically relevant heterogeneity using gene expression data.

Currently focusing on RNA-seq analysis, transcriptomics, and single-cell data analysis.

## ⭐ Primary Research Project

### Reproducible Cancer Transcriptomics — TCGA Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (RNA-seq)

🔗 https://github.com/ag48665/tcga-lusc-biomarker-analysis

End-to-end computational genomics study analyzing TCGA lung cancer RNA-seq data to identify tumor biology and clinically relevant biomarkers.

**What this project demonstrates**

• Automated download and processing of TCGA data (`TCGAbiolinks`)
• Differential expression analysis (`DESeq2`)
• Functional interpretation (Gene Ontology & KEGG pathway enrichment)
• Construction of a multi-gene prognostic expression signature
• Survival modeling (Kaplan–Meier and multivariate Cox regression)
• External validation in an independent GEO cohort
• Fully reproducible one-command analysis pipeline

**Key scientific finding**

Tumor transcriptomic programs reflecting squamous epithelial differentiation and immune activation stratify patients by overall survival, indicating biologically meaningful heterogeneity within lung squamous cell carcinoma.
