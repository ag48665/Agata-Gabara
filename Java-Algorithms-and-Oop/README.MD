# Java Programming Fundamentals – Algorithms & OOP

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Java programs created to practice core programming concepts, object-oriented programming, and basic algorithms.

The goal of this project was to strengthen understanding of how programs work internally rather than building a user interface.
It focuses on **problem solving, data handling, and algorithm implementation**.

## Concepts Covered

The project demonstrates fundamental Computer Science topics:

* Arrays and array manipulation
* User input handling
* Exception handling (try–catch)
* Encapsulation (getters and setters)
* Object-Oriented Programming principles
* Searching algorithms
* Sorting algorithms

## Implemented Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Sorts an array of integers by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements when they are in the wrong order.

Key learning:

* loops
* comparisons
* algorithm efficiency

### Linear Search

Searches for a value inside an array by checking each element sequentially.

Key learning:

* iteration
* condition checking
* returning index values

## Object-Oriented Programming

The project demonstrates encapsulation by using private variables with public getter and setter methods.

Topics practiced:

* classes
* attributes
* methods
* data protection

## Exception Handling

The application uses try–catch blocks to safely process user input and prevent crashes (for example invalid number input).

## Technologies

* Java
* IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
* Standard Java Libraries (Scanner, JOptionPane, ArrayList)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/java-algorithms-and-oop.git
```

2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

3. Compile and run any class with a `main` method.

## What I Learned

Through this project I practiced:

* debugging
* handling runtime errors
* implementing algorithms manually
* writing structured Java code
* understanding how memory and arrays work

## Author

Created as a programming fundamentals practice project.
