# Java Algorithms and OOP Practice Project

A Java console application created to practice fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and object-oriented programming techniques.

This project focuses on implementing common data structures and algorithms while learning exception handling and encapsulation.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose

The aim of this project was to strengthen Java programming skills by implementing core programming methods manually instead of using built-in utilities.

The program demonstrates how algorithms work internally and how object-oriented design improves code structure.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming

* Classes and objects
* Encapsulation
* Getters and setters
* Method design

### Exception Handling

* try / catch blocks
* Handling invalid input
* Preventing program crashes

### Data Structures

* Arrays
* ArrayList collections

---

## ⚙️ Implemented Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Sorts numbers by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

### Linear Search

Searches for a value in an array by checking each element sequentially until the element is found or the list ends.

### Array Operations

* Filling arrays
* Printing arrays
* Swapping values
* Iteration using loops

---

## 🔐 Encapsulation

The project includes private class attributes with public getter and setter methods to control access to internal data and improve program safety.

---

## 🧪 Exception Handling

The program uses `try-catch` blocks to detect invalid input (for example entering text instead of a number) and prevent runtime errors.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Console input/output
* Standard Java libraries

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Requirements

* JDK (Java Development Kit) installed
* Command line or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans)

### Steps

1. Compile the program:

```
javac Main.java
```

2. Run the program:

```
java Main
```
