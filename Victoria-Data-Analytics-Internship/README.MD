# 📊 Victoria Solutions — Data Analytics Internship Project

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a Data Analytics Internship with *Victoria Solutions*.
The goal of the project was to analyze business data and extract actionable insights to support decision-making.

The analysis focuses on:

* identifying sales trends
* understanding customer behavior
* detecting high-value customer segments
* improving business performance

## Business Problem

The company had large datasets but lacked clear insights about:

* which products sell best
* when sales peak
* who the most valuable customers are
* where revenue losses occur

The objective was to transform raw data into meaningful business intelligence.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains:

* customer information
* transaction records
* product categories
* order dates
* revenue values

Data preparation steps:

* removed missing values
* corrected incorrect entries
* standardized date formats
* created calculated fields (profit, monthly sales, customer value)

---

## Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
* Excel

---

## Data Analysis Process

1. Data Cleaning
   Handled missing values and inconsistent records.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Explored patterns, distributions and correlations.

3. Feature Engineering
   Created new metrics such as:

   * Monthly Revenue
   * Customer Lifetime Value
   * Product Performance

4. Visualization
   Created charts to communicate findings clearly.

## Key Insights

* Sales peak during specific months (seasonality detected)
* A small percentage of customers generates most revenue
* Certain product categories consistently underperform
* Repeat customers are significantly more profitable

## Visualizations

Example outputs are available in the **/visuals** folder:

* sales trend analysis
* customer segmentation
* revenue distribution
