Exploratory Survival Analysis of Breast Cancer Patients Using the METABRIC Dataset (Power BI)Project OverviewThis project presents an exploratory time-to-event (survival) analysis of breast cancer patients using the publicly available METABRIC (Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium) clinical dataset.The goal of the project was to demonstrate the ability to:Prepare real clinical data for analysisDefine survival endpointsHandle censored observationsImplement Kaplan–Meier–style survival estimationTranslate biomedical questions into an interactive analytical dashboardAll analysis, transformation, and visualization were implemented entirely inside Microsoft Power BI, combining ETL, analytical logic, and visual analytics in a single platform.📄 Project report: report.pdfDatasetSource:METABRIC breast cancer cohort (Kaggle public dataset)https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/breast-cancer-metabric-data-survival-curves/inputSample Size: ~2,500 patientsKey Clinical VariablesOverall Survival (months)Relapse-Free Survival (months)Survival status (Living / Deceased)Estrogen Receptor (ER) statusMolecular subtype (PAM50 classification)Treatment and pathological featuresThe dataset is widely used in computational oncology research and contains both clinical and molecular characteristics of breast cancer tumors.Data Preparation (ETL)Data preprocessing was performed using Power Query inside Power BI.Cleaning and TransformationConverted time-to-event variables to numeric formatRemoved invalid or inconsistent entriesVerified clinical consistency across variablesCreation of Survival EndpointsTwo binary event indicators were created:Variable	MeaningOS_Event	1 = patient deceased, 0 = censoredRFS_Event	1 = relapse occurred, 0 = censoredHandling Censored DataMissing or incomplete follow-up data were treated using clinical censoring logic, ensuring proper survival analysis assumptions:Patients alive at last follow-up → censoredNo relapse recorded → censoredThis step was critical to make the dataset valid for survival modeling.Survival AnalysisMedian Survival EstimationThe dashboard dynamically calculates:Median Overall Survival (OS)Median Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)These values automatically update when filters are applied (e.g., subtype, ER status).Kaplan–Meier–Style Survival CurveA Kaplan–Meier–style overall survival curve was implemented directly in Power BI using DAX measures.Methodology:Discrete monthly time binsRisk-set based survival probabilityCensoring-aware calculationsThe survival probability decreases over time as expected for real oncology cohorts and is consistent with published METABRIC analyses report.pdf.Example VisualizationThe KM survival plot below compares overall survival by ER status:InterpretationThe analysis suggests no strong separation in overall survival between ER-positive and ER-negative groups in this cohort report.pdf.Stratified Survival ExplorationInteractive filtering allows users to explore survival trends across biologically meaningful groups:Estrogen Receptor (ER) statusMolecular subtype (PAM50)This enables exploratory clinical questions such as:Do luminal tumors survive longer?Does receptor status affect prognosis?How does relapse relate to subtype?Power BI Analytical Logic (DAX)Key analytical components implemented:Risk set calculationEvent counting per time intervalSurvival probability estimationCumulative survival productDynamic median survival extractionThis effectively reproduces Kaplan–Meier behavior inside a BI tool rather than statistical software.Skills DemonstratedData Science / BioinformaticsSurvival analysis conceptsTime-to-event data modelingHandling censored clinical dataBiomedical dataset interpretationData AnalyticsETL with Power QueryAdvanced DAX measuresInteractive dashboard designAnalytical storytellingSoftware & ToolsMicrosoft Power BIPower QueryDAXClinical dataset preprocessingWhy This Project MattersClinical datasets are messy, incomplete, and censored.This project demonstrates the ability to work with real biomedical data, not clean tutorial datasets.It shows the capability to:understand clinical variables,apply statistical reasoning,and communicate findings visually.These skills are directly applicable to:bioinformaticsclinical data sciencehealthcare analyticscomputational biologyPossible Future ImprovementsCox proportional hazards modeling (Python / R)Statistical significance testing (log-rank test)Integration with gene expression dataFeature importance / prognostic modelingMachine learning survival models (Random Survival Forests)
