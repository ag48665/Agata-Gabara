Power BI Exercises & Dashboards

This repository contains a collection of Power BI exercises, dashboards, and data exploration projects created as part of my ongoing learning in data analytics, business intelligence, and data visualization. The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in transforming raw datasets into meaningful, interactive visual insights using Power BI.

Project Overview

The included .pbix file showcases:

Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query
Data modelling with relationships, DAX calculations, and measures
Interactive dashboards using slicers, drill-throughs, tooltips, and dynamic visuals
